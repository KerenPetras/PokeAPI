# Pokemon PokedexAPI 2nd Hackathon Project // Using Node.js Environment 

## Description

The project is a website created in Node.js and inspired by the world of Pokemon. I used the PokeAPI, a free and open-source API for Pokemon-related data, to fetch information about different Pokemon species. The website features a variety of pages, including a Pokedex page where users can view information about different Pokemons.

To make the website more dynamic, I utilized JavaScript functions to retrieve and display data from the PokeAPI. For example, the "getPokemon" function was used to fetch information about a specific Pokemon and display it on the appropriate page.

While the project was initially built without a database, I am now exploring options for adding a database to the Node.js environment to enhance the functionality of the website. Overall, the project showcases the power of Node.js and its ability to create dynamic and engaging websites using data from third-party APIs.
