Pokedex project.
I will firstly say that the concept is really cool.
I think your design is very professional , I love the animaton of the homepage when you enter.
When clicking on the homepage I would implement a scroll up script instead of linking to the page again so the animation
that already happend doesnt happen again.
 I saw you are aware of the lack of database here. It would be great if you connected a database used it for anything.
Also I would find another use for your server except servering the static html file.
I think this project has a lot of potential, so I say keep working on it!	
Keep at it and good job!
